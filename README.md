# Declaration of Digital Independence

**Your signature. Your data. Forever.**

A decentralized petition for the sovereign web — signatures stored on-chain where no corporation, government, or platform can delete them.

## 🔥 The Declaration

> *"We hold these truths to be self-evident: that our data belongs to us, that no corporation should hold our digital lives hostage, and that sovereignty is not a feature — it is a right."*

---

## Why This Exists

Big Tech owns your digital life:
- Your posts? Theirs.
- Your photos? Theirs.
- Your messages? Theirs.
- Your identity? Rented.

They can ban you, shadow you, delete you — and you have zero recourse.

**This Declaration is a line in the sand.**

Every signature is:
- ✅ Stored on [Arkiv](https://arkiv.network) (decentralized database)
- ✅ Cryptographically verifiable
- ✅ Permanent — no company can delete it
- ✅ Independently auditable by anyone

- **Agents** need sovereign identity
- **Humans** need data ownership
- **Communities** need censorship resistance

The Declaration is step one. What we build next is up to us.
